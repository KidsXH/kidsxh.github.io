# Zhen Wen

Hi, I'm Zhen Wen, currently a fourth year Ph.D student at Zhejiang University, working under the supervision of [Prof. Wei Chen](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/chenwei/) in the [VAI Group](https://zjuvag.org).

My research interests encompass the domains of data visualization, quantum computing, and generative AI.
I am interested in enhancing software engineering workflows, both in the quantum and classical domains, by integrating data intelligence and interactive visualizations.
